> Open table formats empower companies to bring compute to their data while maintaining a single copy of data. At Capital One, we use Iceberg Tables to optimize ingestion and storage costs in Snowflake without compromising data integrity or performance. This enables us to expand how we leverage Snowflake's capabilities for diverse workloads. In this session, we'll share how Iceberg helps us democratize compute choices along with key learnings from migrating datasets from native Snowflake tables.
