> In this joint Ericsson and Snowflake presentation, we showcase an AI-powered drone solution that leverages LiDAR, 5G and cloud AI to transform real-world operations. Our approach enables real-time capture and processing of high-resolution 3D data, seamlessly streaming insights via programmable networks. By integrating AI-driven analytics with Snowflakeâ€™s scalable data platform, we unlock new efficiencies in telecom, disaster response and industrial automation.

## Overview

Session about revolutionizing industries with AI-powered drone intelligence.

## Key Points

- Telco edge to data (20 ms)
- "Cannot use the term 'one minute' and 'realtime' at the same time in telco"
- How to get insights out of the drone data
- Combine with other mapping data sources (roads, vegetation index, etc)
